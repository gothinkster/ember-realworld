# ![RealWorld Ember Example App](logo-ember.png)
> ### Ember.js codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld-example-apps) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://ember.realworld.io/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gothinkster/ember-realworld.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gothinkster/ember-realworld)

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **Ember** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **Ember** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (with NPM)
* [Bower](http://bower.io/)
* [Ember CLI](http://www.ember-cli.com/)
* [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/)

# How it works

> Describe the general architecture of your app here

# Getting started

## Installation

* `git clone <https://github.com/gothinkster/ember-realworld.git>` this repository
* change into the new directory
* `yarn`

## Running / Development

* `ember serve` or `yarn start`
* Visit your app at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).

When running in development mode the application will use mock data, if you would like 
to run against the real conduit API you can do the following:

* `ember serve --proxy https://conduit.productionready.io` or `yarn start:dev`

### Code Generators

Make use of the many generators for code, try `ember help generate` for more details

### Linting

This project uses a combination of [ESLint][eslint] and [Prettier][prettier] to maintain uniform style for our JavaScript code.

To run verification of the code, but not fix anything automatically, you can run

* `yarn lint`

However, thanks to the power of the tools we use, many problems can be fixed automatically.  That can be done by running

* `yarn lint:fix`

Which will detect which problems can be fixed automatically and write the correct version back to the files in question.

### Running Tests

* `ember test` or `yarn test`
* `ember test --serve` or `yarn test:s`

### Building

* `ember build` (development)
* `ember build --environment production` (production)

### Deploying
